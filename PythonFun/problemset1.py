#FINDING TEXT

# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# For example,
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
# text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1

text = "all zip files are zipped"

#write code bellow

first_app = text.find("zip", 0)
print text.find("zip", first_app + 1)

# ROUNDING NUMBERS

# Given a variable, x, that stores the 
# value of any decimal number, write Python 
# code that prints out the nearest whole 
# number to x.
# If x is exactly half way between two 
# whole numbers, round up, so
# 3.5 rounds to 4 and 2.5 rounds to 3.
# You may assume x is not negative.

# Hint: The str function can convert any number into a string.
# eg str(89) converts the number 89 to the string '89'

# Along with the str function, this problem can be solved 
# using just the information introduced in unit 1.

# x = 3.14159 
# >>> 3 (not 3.0)
# x = 27.63 
# >>> 28 (not 28.0)
# x = 3.5 
# >>> 4 (not 4.0)

x = 3.14159

#write code bellow

new_value = x + 0.5
string = str(new_value)
decimal = string.find(".")
print string[:decimal]

#UNIT 2

# Define a procedure, find_second, that takes
# two strings as its inputs: a search string
# and a target string. It should return a
# number that is the position of the second
# occurrence of the target string in the
# search string.

def find_second(search,target):
	first = search.find(target)
	return search.find(target, first + 1)
    	


danton = "De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace"
print find_second(danton, 'audace')
#>>> 25

twister = "she sells seashells by the seashore"
print find_second(twister,'she')
#>>> 13


# UNIT 2 - BIGGEST
# Define a procedure, biggest, that takes three
# numbers as inputs and returns the largest of
# those three numbers.

def bigger(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b

def biggest(a,b,c):
	return bigger((a, b), c)

print max(a, b, c)

print biggest(3, 6, 9)
#>>> 9

print biggest(6, 9, 3)
#>>> 9

print biggest(9, 3, 6)
#>>> 9

#print biggest(3, 3, 9)
#>>> 9

#print biggest(9, 3, 9)
#>>> 9
